# Movie-Recommender-using-Spark-MLlib
We are going to illustrate the power of Spark by using the "movielens" dataset, which contains 100k ratings for movies through1997, and recommend movies to the user based on his previous ratings. For this, we will predict the movie a user would like to watch based on his previous ratings for movies (just like Netflix would reccomend you movies to watch based on the movies you have already watched and obviously many more features which we will not be touching upon today).


**About the Data:**

MovieLens data sets were collected by the GroupLens Research Project
at the University of Minnesota. This data set consists of:

•	100,000 ratings (1-5) from 943 users on 1682 movies

•	Each user has rated at least 20 movies

•	Simple demographic info for the users (age, gender, occupation, zip)
